# Assignment 2
Before running the script, ensure that the assignment_1 folder consists of the following directories:
```
data/
output/
```
This assignment only needs one image and therefore it is included in the repository already. Should there be a problem, the image can be found on the following link

https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f4/%22We_Hold_These_Truths%22_at_Jefferson_Memorial_IMG_4729.JPG

And should be downloaded and placed inside the data folder and renamed `memorial.jpg`

To run the script make sure that the virtual environment is activated. Make sure that you have changed to the assignment_2 directory and run the following command:

```
python edge_detection.py
```

The output folder should now contain three files:
- `image_cropped.jpg`
- `image_letters.jpg`
- `image_with_ROI.jpg`
